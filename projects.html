            <p>Thanics is a company I co-founded along with 2 friends from High School. We are currently working on a prosumer quadcopter, Halo, designed to
              fix many of the safety issues with current drones. Our main areas of focus have been safety, usability, and versatility. From the beginning, 
              one of our biggest goals was to improve the safety of quadcopters, ourselves being drone hobyists and expericed with the negative effects of 
              quadcopter mistakes. This is the reason for the quadcopter's box-like design. The outer shell, which is made of Carbon Fiber for weight and
              durability, serves first as a barrier between the blades and anyone near or in contact with the drone. This unique shell also houses all
              the electronics and processing units for the quadcopter. I am mostly in charge of the software aspects of Halo, specifically the software
              running on the quadcopter.</p>

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <img class="w3-image" src="InternshipImage.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover page of the paper I co-published">
            <p>Over the summer, I worked with a professor from the Naval Academy on a research project. The project involved creating software and algorithms
              for modeling and predicting the insulin and glucose levels of diabetic patients. My main contribution was optimizing a piece of matlab code to 
              run faster. The issue was that my mentor had a matlab script that could made a mathematical model of a diabetic patient based on measured values
              from the patient, but this program would take somewhere from 2-4 hours to run per patient. This particularly posed a problem to us because we 
              wanted to generate in the order of several hundred patients in order to analyze how accurate the predictions were across a large data set. We 
              did not want to wait 50 days in order to create the models; especially if it turned out there was an error in the program. One solution for creating
              the dataset would have been to run the processes in parallel, but this would require more processing power, and the application of the research 
              would be providing a finished tool for doctors to use in prescribing medication for patients, so the solution was not as simple as just using a 
              larger computer, since we can not influence the computer the end user may use. In order to decrease the time it took to run the program, I focused
              on reducing the number of variables the program had to optimise, while still maintaining reasonable accuracy. In the end, I was successful in doing
              so, and was able to reduce the run time of the program from hours down to a few minutes. Participating in this research was an amazing experience 
              for me because it allowed me to apply my knowledge of programming and mathematics to a field I was unfamiliar with. The research also provided
              context for concepts I learned in school, such as various techniques in calculus.

            <p>In tenth grade, my science teacher assigned our class to create two small rockets; one powered by compressed air and one powered by an acid-base reaction.
              My partner and I decided to combine the two, and create one rocket capable of being propelled by either method. We also decided to go big, with the final rocket
              standing almost 4-feet tall (as opposed to the upside-down water bottles many of my classmates created). In order to propel such a large rocket, we decided it
              would need to be at a high pressure (our estimates were a couple hundred psi), and the rocket would need to remain light. To do this, we decided to create a 
              3-foot tall, carbon fiber pressure tank as the centerpiece of the rocket. Carbon fiber met all the criteria were looking for; it was lightweight, high strength,
              and could be bought on Amazon. Neither of us knew how to fabricate something out of carbon fiber, so I volunteered to learn. Our first step was to design the 
              pressure tank and housing, which we did in Autocad Inventor, and ran structural analysis to verify that our pressure tank design could theoretically hold
              600psi before undergoing a RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly). The next steps were to 3d-print the outer casing and pressure tank mold, which we distributed
              across several printers at our school and our houses (I forgot to mention, we were on a strict time schedule. Ever hour of production was planned, and we
              barely got everything printed in time.) After buying supplies off Amazon, and watching youtube videos about carbon fiber, I set to work making the pressure tank.
              Using a hand layup and skinning process, I wrapped a 3d-printed shell in several layers of carbon fiber to create the pressure tank. I remember I put on the last 
              coat of epoxy with the exact number of hours before the project as was needed to cure the epoxy. After working late into the night and early into the morning 
              each day on the project, anticipation was high when we went to test it for the teacher. We set up the rocket, pumped it with air, and fsssssss.... Turns out, 
              carbon fiber is, well, a fiber. And, fibers, like fabrics, are porous. So, as we filled the tank, the air simply leaked out through the carbon fiber skin. For 
              a couple weeks after the first test, I tried putting on more layers of epoxy to seal the holes, but was unsuccessful. The moral of the story is, although we 
              were not successful at launching a rocket, we tried things far beyond the requirements, and learned technologies like CAD structural analysis and high-performance 
              composite fabrication that we would not have learned had we taken the easy road.

              on quadcopter performance, specificaly finding the relationship between the ideal propeller pitch and weight of the quadcopter. We were able to
              directly apply our findings to designing the propellers on Halo, our company's quadcopter in development.

            <p>Both Freshman and Sophomore years of High School, I participated in my school's FTC robotics team; sophomore year as a team captain.
              Freshman year, I worked on our robot's autonomous code, and was able to develop a program that would use an IR sensor array to track
              an IR emitter. The code would then line up the robot in front of a 3-foot high goal, the robot would autonomously raise its arm, and then
              deposit a ball into the goal. Sophomore year, I was assigned a team captain, so I spent the year bouncing around to different stations. Our
              robotics organization consists of 3 FTC teams, and one FRC team. The larger FRC team has a dedicated design group that CAD models the robot
              before fabrication, and is thus able to work through bugs in the design ahead of time and be more efficient with fabrication. I noticed this,
              so I implemented a similar group in my FTC team, and we were the first FTC team at our school to do so; other teams have since followed suit.
              We did run into many problems with timing and practicality, but I would say it was overall a success.
