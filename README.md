# school-Portfolio
This is just a repo for storing a personal project I am working on, my web portfolio for college. It is made using w3.css and hosted on 
Microsoft Azure web services, with a Node.js backend. The server uses continuous deployment with this git repository, so any changes here are
automatically reflected on the server. Not good for large projects, but with only one contributor it works well enough.
